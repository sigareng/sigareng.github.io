I'm a web developer in Indonesian.

Web Developer more than Five years of experience in designing and developing user interfaces, testing, debugging, and training staff within eCommerce technologies. Proven ability in optimizing web functionality that improve data retrieval and workflow efficiencies.

My approach to development prides keeping things light, efficient, and unique. You won't see my projects using an off-the-shelf theme that's tweaked a little bit, or an overbloated drag & drop solution that sacrifices performance or SEO. If we're going to build something, we're going to build it right, performant, and effective.

If you want a uniquely designed and beautifully handcrafted website, or a feature rich progressive web app, then you should contact me. I can start from scratch or re-work what you've got, making sure it's fully responsive and inclusive.
